Objective
- find the most efficient way to process all the documents in the given timeline

# Parallel Processor

This program allows multiple customers to put in a request to process documents while following the SLA (service-level agreement). It simulates the processing time with a delay of 1 second for each estimated minute. The algorithm finds a cost efficient way to process the customers' request in parallel. The following are assumptions that the program is built upon:
1) $5/h for each processor
2) it takes 1 minute to process 1 document
3) each processor is auto-charged (once you use one, $5 is charged automatically)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
