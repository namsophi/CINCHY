# Parallel Processor

This program allows multiple customers to put in a request to process documents while following the SLA (service-level agreement). It simulates the processing time with a delay of 1 second for each estimated minute. The algorithm finds a cost efficient way to process the customers' request in parallel. The following are assumptions that the program is built upon:
1) $5/h for each processor
2) it takes 1 minute to process 1 document
3) each processor is auto-charged (once you use one, $5 is charged automatically)
